cells <- c(1,2,3,4,5,1,5,3,6,2,1,3,2,7,3,1,9,5,4,2,1,5,6,8,4,1,6,3,3,2)
rnames <- c("fixed cost","material cost","salary","inventory cost","operation and maintenance cost")
cnames <- c("A","B","C","D","E","F")
Y <- matrix(cells, nrow = 5, ncol = 6, byrow = FALSE, dimnames= list(rnames,cnames))
print(Y)
```
